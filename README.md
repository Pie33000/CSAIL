Case I want to deal with:
- assignments, increments, auto-incrementation, arithmetic operators, comparisons, logical and bitwise operators
- passage by referencing
- handle pointers, two pointers can pointer to the same address, content pointed by a pointer, de-referencing pointers
- manage structures, and structure pointers, where terms can themselves be pointers
- You must also manage all types of variables (short, char, int, float, array, bytes, string ...)
- returns and called functions that can create or modify variables by referencing
- we can also manage global variables static or not
- function pointers
